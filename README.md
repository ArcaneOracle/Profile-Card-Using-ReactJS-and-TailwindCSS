# Hi, I'm Deon! 👋
## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently learning full-stack web-development. I started coding as a hobby since May of 2022 and aspire to do it professionally one day.

I fell in love with web-development because of all the challenges you have to overcome.
I also like the fact that there are numerous ways to overcome the same problem, and as a result, get to show your creativeness.

## Other Common Github Profile Sections
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on basic websites using TailWind as my front-end styling framework, as I prefer using it over bootstrap.
🧠 I'm currently learning full-stack web-development.

## 🛠 Skills
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, AlpineJS.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
